\contentsline {todo}{6. The gadgets in the figure are made up, chosen to highlight that each gadget can end in a different type of indirect control flow transfer instruction.

Describe other mechanisms for detecting memory errors, both software-based (static analysis, library and buffer hardening) and hardware-based, e.g.\nobreakspace {}PAuth-based pointer integrity schemes, MTE etc \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/170}{\#170}}{27}{section*.17}%
\contentsline {todo}{12. {Also discuss the techniques implemented in the \href {https://github.com/pietroborrello/constantine}{Constatine compiler} \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/172}{\#172}}}{32}{section*.18}%
\contentsline {todo}{13. Also explain cache coherency ? \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/173}{\#173}}{34}{section*.21}%

\contentsline {todo}{15. Should there be a more elaborate example with code that demonstrates in more detail how a flush+reload attack works? \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/175}{\#175}}{35}{section*.23}%

\contentsline {todo}{21. Explain how these vulnerabilities arise and how to mitigate them. \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/180}{\#180}}{42}{section*.29}%
\contentsline {todo}{22. Explain how code that results in undefined behaviour can often work as the programmer expected until some optimisation is applied, and perhaps even talk a bit about why compilers rely on the absence of undefined behaviour in ways that appear aggressive in some occasions. \href {https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/issues/202}{\#202}}{43}{section*.30}%
