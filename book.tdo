\contentsline {todo}{4. Consider describing in more detail why the range limitation matters}{6}{section*.5}%
\contentsline {todo}{5. The references in this section describe complicated modern exploits. Consider linking to simpler exploits, as well as some tutorial-level material.}{7}{section*.6}%

\contentsline {todo}{7. Rethink the later sections of this chapter and the order in which issues and mitigations are presented. The "non-control data exploits" section should probably include, or be followed by, a section on the various sanitizers available (ASan, UBSan, etc).}{12}{section*.9}%
